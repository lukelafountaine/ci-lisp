Expand the interpreter that you built in Task 1 by adding the following functions:

exp2()
cbrt()
hypot()
and modify log() so that it takes two parameters:

log(<base>, <value>)
where <base> can be either 2 or 10.

Please study the functions available from the Math library by issuing the following command:

$ man math
